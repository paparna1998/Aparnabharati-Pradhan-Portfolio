        The maritime history of Europe represents an era of human interaction
        with the sea, primarily in North-western Europe, which consists of
        Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and the United Kingdom, among other
        countries. There has been immense human activity in these areas of
        North-western Europe since the earliest days of Europe, majorly through
        affairs like shipping, whaling, naval battles, and military
        installations like lighthouses, etc. The seas and oceans complement a
        significant part of European history because Europeans greatly
        facilitated the influence of maritime traffic & commerce and further
        harnessed it in exploring the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, today many scientists and archaeologists are working for
        preserving the cultural history and heritage that has been safely
        reposed in deep waters for centuries, away from any artificial harm and
        destruction. Until June 2019, when a group of archaeologists set out to
        explore the seabed near Svalbard—a large, ice-covered Norwegian
        archipelago situated halfway between continental Norway and the North
        Pole find Dutch ships sunk by the French in the 17th century.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this group was ØyvindØdegård, a marine archaeologist at the Norwegian
        University of Science and Technology who has worked for decades to
        protect Norway's underwater cultural heritage—the shipwrecks and other
        artefacts. Ødegård and his team outlined promising spots in the ocean
        with the help of historical reports made to France's King at the time-
        Louis XIV. But when the unit deployed underwater drones for inspection,
        they found nothing at all, to their utter surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The explorers could find literally nothing on the seabed. There are
        historical records and evidence about thousands of European whaling
        ships that ventured to Svalbard, out of which many never left the frozen
        islands. These ships were either buried in sea ice due to storms and
        blizzards or drowned by enemy fleets. Finding them could have provided
        new revelations for many undiscovered parts of European history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 16th century, thousands of European whaling ships were
        reported to have gone to Svalbard to hunt the massive whale population
        of the region. During this period, much of European Arctic history was
        made from the shipping world on the sea rather than land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ødegård and his crew deduced that the ship ruins were once present on
        the seabed but had disappeared over a long period. And, since no human
        excursion had been embarked upon to explore the Arctic seabed for
        studying and analysing ship wreckage, the ruins weren't removed by
        humans but by the ravening creatures of the sea that are 'shipworms'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shipworms are marine creatures with long, soft, naked bodies notoriously
        known for boring into, and eventually destroying, wood immersed in
        seawater, including wooden piers, docks, and ships. In just a few years,
        a sizable infestation can ruin a sunken boat and everything inside the
        vessel- from human remains to archaeological artefacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The habitability of shipworms in the coldest regions on earth was
        hitherto unknown. These creatures have long been recognised as an
        archaeological threat. Still, they weren't considered as potential
        threats to the unexplored wreckage lying on the seafloor, as the
        temperatures here are too cold for them to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the exploratory trip to Svalbard suggested that underwater
        heritage, perhaps, across the world's northern oceans may not just be
        simply be lying there, cleanly preserved and waiting to be discovered.
        Natural attributes have begun to adversely affect the shipwrecks that,
        for centuries, remained relatively preserved. With the presence of
        shipworms in the coldest regions of the Arctic, it can also be inferred
        that ocean currents and climate change are playing a significant role in
        bringing warm water masses into the Arctic and subarctic regions.
        Research into whether the shipworms found in the northern areas are a
        southern species that moved north or an all-new species that thrive in
        colder water is underway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ødegård is now planning to work with other researchers to better address
        shipworms' situation in the western Arctic region. Matthew Ayre, a
        climate chronicler at the University of Calgary in Alberta, aims to work
        with Ødegård to locate wrecks near Greenland, another cold island region
        in the east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Although currently, the
        shipworm threat is confirmed only around Svalbard, there are chances
        that it might have moved to other regions where the oceanic climate has
        begun to turn warm due to climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ayre's work isn't majorly focused on ship wreckage destruction. He has
        expertise in examining historical records such as captain's notes, which
        give a complete and accurate explanation of weather conditions and
        shipping details. This data is then used to provide a comprehensive
        picture of the historic Arctic climate and improve future climate
        modelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ødegård also plans on collaborating with Maxime Geoffroy, a marine
        biologist at the Memorial University of New Foundland and the University
        of Labrador. They plan to conduct an experiment in which they will
        search for shipworms off the coast of Labrador in the Canadian province
        of Newfoundland and Labrador. The idea is to collect logs of the same
        tree varieties utilised to build whaling ships, weigh them down with
        chains, and immerse them in 50 meters. A year later, they were pulled up
        and inspected for worms' presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the conditions in Labrador may be very different from those of
        Svalbard, it is imperative to make such collective efforts to understand
        better the threat posed by shipworms and thus by climate change in cold
        regions of the Arctic. It is essential to find out and neutralise the
        dangers posed by creatures such as shipworms, which is further induced
        by the monumental climate crisis we face today, to preserve the
        historical evidence for exploring European history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ascertaining these material remains ere it's too late is crucial for
        bringing to life a story more relevant today than ever. In Europe's
        history of whaling, one of the first humans inflicted catastrophes on
        nature is apparent. And for telling a story of vices and their
        consequences, the intricate material proof is requisite for human
        psychology to comprehend and relate to.
