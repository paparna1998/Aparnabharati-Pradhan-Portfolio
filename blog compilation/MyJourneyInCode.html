            <h2>Why this blog?</h2>
            <p>
                I am Aparnabharati. I have completed my B.Tech in CS from Mumbai University. I have self-learned a lot on my journey of programming. This blog is dedicated to everyone who dreams of becoming a good programmer.
                I want that you read the entire blog in depth so that you can get the most aware from it.
                You may or may not be from CS and IT branches but you can still have a career in the IT sector. I want to elaborate more that “How do I start programming?”.
            </p>
            <h2>The beginning of my journey </h2>
            <p>
              Before taking admission in computer science,I have bit knowledge about programming such as HTML and CSS because In high school, we have a computer subject as an optional subject.Due to which I wanted to take my bit knowedge into new heights.Later I came to realize that HTML was not even a programming language.
              When I became comfortable in university, the programmer in me became equally uncomfortable, because they don’t teach you elaborate programming in First-Year except for basic C problem-solving. Almost all computer science students had been doing programming since their high school, and some were from different streams beacuse in First-Year all students used to sit  together with different section. I started to feel very scared. I felt, “When would I be coding like such students and did I blunder to take admission in this stream? I don’t even know basic logic building yet!”. Don’t worry everyone starts just like this.

            <p>
              The moment you kick start your journey with computer science.You have to learn a programming language and that is must.After banging my head a lot for choosing my first language and eventually I selected JavaScript. You can have many options such as C++, Python, or JavaScript, whatever suits you. Many beginner tutorials out there give suggestions about Python being the easiest language (because you don’t have to write more code). That’s what makes it unsuitable to start with. The reason is, shifting from C++ or Java to Python is easy, whereas the other way round is miserable.
              You can handle things that are close to the execution level in C/Java which will push you to explore how the language works internally. Other languages come with a lot of abstraction layers for programmers to not worry about background processes.
              After working with JavaScript for a while, I realized that the time has come to move on. It will teach you concepts like the basics of data types, loops, pointers, and then the more advanced concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), data structures, etc. It’s absolutely fine if you didn’t get any of these right now.Always remember one thing once you start working with coding do always focus on logic and play along with it and that is must. Once you learn how to build logic building you will have to easily deal with each and every programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wish to be better as a programmer I highly recommend that you cover your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) first, before moving onto making cool projects. Learning DSA will give you knowledge on how to make efficient code, and not just code that works. This is an important skill that’s hunted by recruiters when you will try to apply for jobs.
              After getting some suggestions, I started following some tutorials for JavaScript. Whenever you would do a course (on Coursera, Udemy, etc, and obviously YouTube) just follow it till the end.
