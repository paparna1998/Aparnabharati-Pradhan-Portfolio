    </header>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>1. Git Init</h2>
      <p>
        The git init command is usually the first command you’d run in any new
        project that is not already a Git repository (also commonly called
        repo). It can be used to convert an existing, un-versioned folder into a
        Git repository. Also, you can use it to initialize an empty repo.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Git Clone</h2>
      <p>
        The git clone command is used to download the source code from a remote
        repository (like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab).
      </p>
      <h2>3. Git Branch</h2>
      <p>
        Branch is one of the most important functionalities of Git. This allows
        teams to work on the same code base in parallel. It enables teams to
        create Git Workflows and make their workflows more efficient. Say,
        you’re working on “Feature A”. And your teammate is working on “Feature
        B”. By creating a separate branch for each feature, both of you can work
        on the same code base in parallel without having to worry about
        conflicts (at least while you’re writing the code). You can use this
        command to create a new branch, view existing branches, or delete a
        branch.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Git Checkout</h2>
      <p>
        A mistake I often made when I first started learning git commands was
        forgetting to switch to the new branch I just created. Yes, after you
        create a branch, you’ll have to switch to it with another command.
        That’s where the Git Checkout command comes in.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Git Add</h2>
      <p>
        Every time you create a new file, delete it, or make a change, you’ll
        have to tell Git to track it and add it to the staging area. Otherwise,
        the files you made changes to wouldn’t be added when you try to push
        your changes.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Git Commit</h2>
      <p>
        Think of Git Commit command like a checkpoint in your development
        process. It’s commonly used to save your changes. Maybe after completing
        a specific work item assigned to you in your agile tool. Every time you
        commit your code changes, you’ll also include a message to briefly
        describe the changes you made. This helps other team members quickly
        understand what was added, changed, or removed.
      </p>
      <h2>7. Git Push</h2>
      <p>
        To make all your committed changes available to your teammates, you’ll
        have to push them to the remote origin.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Git Pull</h2>
      <p>
        Of course, you’d want to have the latest updates from teammates as well!
        The git pull command allows you to fetch all the changes that your
        teammates pushed and automatically merge them into your local repo.
      </p>
      <h2>9. Git Diff</h2>
      <p>
        Git Diff is my go-to command when I want to quickly see the difference
        between my current branch and another branch (usually the branch I’m
        merging into).
      </p>
      <h2>10. Git Stash</h2>
      <p>
        Git Stash temporarily shelves your work, so you can switch to another
        branch, work on something else, and then come back to this at a later
        time. It’s perfect if you need to work on something else and you’re
        midway through a code change, but aren’t ready to commit the code.
      </p>
      <h2>11. Git Status</h2>
      <p>
        When you’re feeling a bit lost with what’s happened in your repo (yes,
        it can happen) the Git Status command can tell you all the information
        you’ll need to know.
      </p>
      <h2>12. Git Log</h2>
      <p>
        While git status gave you nearly all the information you’d have needed,
        it wouldn’t give you the information about the commit history for the
        repository. This is where the git log command comes into the picture.
      </p>
      <h2>13. Git Merge</h2>
      <p>
        Once you’re done with development inside your feature branch and tested
        your code, you can merge your branch with the parent branch. This could
        be either a develop branch or a master branch depending on the git
        workflow you follow. When running a git merge command, you first need to
        be on the specific branch that you want to merge with your feature
        branch.
